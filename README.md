# AutoLayoutArrangement
An iOS app that demonstrates auto layout using Apple's Base API, FLKAutoLayout, and Interface Builder (IB uses size classes, as well).

*Note: make sure to change the initial view controller in storyboard to use different methods or chnage the class on the ViewController scene.
